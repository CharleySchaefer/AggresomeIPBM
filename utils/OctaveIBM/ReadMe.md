## Purpose

* Molecular understanding of experimentally measured FRAP transients.  
* Coded in Matlab/[octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave) script for efficient algorithm development.  

## Usage

The program is run using matlab or [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave) (freely available open-source alternative).
All parameters are set in the 'USER INPUT' section of the main script *IBM.m*.

Other contents:  
* *src* contains subroutines called by the main script *IBM.m*.
* *utils*: utilities for postprocessing. To use the scripts for plotting, install  [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) (freely available open-source software).
